It was 5.20PM. The streetlights turned on. Claudia was on her way home after a tiresome day at her dreaded school. She stopped by at a bench, took a seat, and admired the sunset. 
"Mom? Can you hear me? I'm doing fine, what about you?" Claudia reached her hand to the sky. "I miss you so much..." 
She opened her eyes. "Hello, can you hear me? Please wake up! Please I beg you!" It was an unfamilliar voice. He seemed worried sick. Was he worried for me? Where am I...
"Who...who are you." She said, as she choked on blood. She slowly sat up. This is...my apartment? There was blood all over the walls. 
"Are you okay?" the boy said. He seemed around my age, he was wearing a cute t-shirt with a jacket. Hold on, isn't it 30 degrees outside? But I have never seen him in my life. 
That's strange,
What was he doing in my house? 
"Who..who are you?" 
Before She could hear his reply, my vision blurred. And soon, she fainted. 
She opened her eyes. She was back at the bench. It was the next day. "What happened?" 
She took her stuff, her legs wobbly, she walked back home. Was that all just a dream?

Back at it. The same scene unfolded right before my eyes. But this time, I wasn't the one lying on the floor. I walked out of this unfamilliar room, this seemed to be my apartment?
The first thing I saw was a man, holding a knife. He stabbed the boy, said some words I could not hear properly, and immediately ran out of the house. 
Blood was flowing like a river. I was afraid. No, I must save this man! He cared for me the previous time! Wait, but is this just another dream? This is just so strange.
Hesitantly, I walked up to the man. Slowly, with small quiet steps, I reached him. The scene of the wound scarred me. "Are...are you okay Mr?" 
He tried to breath, but was in pain. "Do I look... like I am?"
"SORRY!" I quickly got a piece of cloth to stop the blood from flowing. "Hang in there, Mr"
"Just let me die, I deserved this." He said, this time clearly and fluently.
"Huh? Why? No no, I mean, How could you. I am going to save you."
I tried to reach for my phone from my pocket, but obviously it wasn't there. 
I went to my room and looked all over, no phone.
This man was dying, what am I supposed to do?"
At this second, the boy said," Did you order pizza?" 
I quickly shook my head intensely. 

"Claudia, wake up! You are already late for school!" I got a shock. I sat up on my bed. "Another dream? Why did it seem so real?"
I rushed out of my house, not even saying goodbye to my family.
On the bus to school, thoughts rushed past my mind, Who Was That Boy?
I alighted the bus and rushed to my homeroom. "Sorry I'm late Mrs..." 
The class stared at me weirdly. Did... did I do something wrong? I mean besides being late.
"Who are you, girl?"
"What? I'm Claudia, Claudia Park! I'm in your class!"
"Oh so you're the new student? Welcome, Claudia Park. Class please give your new classmate a warm welcome." 
I was confused. I have been in this class for almost two years.
I took my seat at my usual spot, it was already left empty for me. 
"Hi, I'm Hillary. Nice to meet you!" 
"Hill? Long time no see!" 
"Um...Have we met?" 
"Hill, don't you remember? We are best buddies! We met during the Year 3 Party, didn't we?" I chuckled. Was my bestfriend joking with me or what!
She looked at me, with a confused look. "I'm sorry, how old are you? We are in year 3 and the party is at the end of this year!
"How could that be..." I laughed. I checked my phone. 1st february, 2016. TWENTY-SIXTEEN? WHAT IS GOING ON?
I bit myself so hard and I felt the pain. "No, this isn't a dream. Okay that was REAL pain."
It was math lesson, the first lesson I ever attended in Averise High. Did I travel back in time? No, houw could that be. It only happens in TV shows.

The bell rang, signalling that it was time for break. I took mt stuff and went out of the classroom. Hillary, Kaylee and Rachel came to me. 
"Hi Claudia, would you..."
"Oh hi Hill, Kay and Rae!"
They stared at me. 
Oh crap they didn't know me yet in 2016. They must think I'm a weirdo.
"Oh, um, you gave us nicknames...already...Wait, you know our names?" Kaylee said.
"Maybe she saw the yearbook. Like I was saying, would you like the sit with us during lunch?"
Yes, that was the friendly, energetic and inclusive Hillary I knew. 
"Sure!" I said as a nodded my head.
Hillary showed me to my locker. "This is your locker, Mrs Ari told me to show you around." She said, with the big smile on her face.
